  abstract =
{We present a generic digit serial method (DSM) to compute the digits
of a real number V. Bounds on these digits, and on the errors in the
associated estimates of V formed from these digits, are derived. To
illustrate our results, we derive bounds for a parameterized family of
high-radix algorithms for division and square root. These bounds
enable hardware designers to determine, for example, whether a given
choice of DSM parameters allows rapid formation and rounding of
approximations to V.}
